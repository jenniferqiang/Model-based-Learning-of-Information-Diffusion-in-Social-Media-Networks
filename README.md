Title: Model-based Learning of Information Diffusion in Social Media Networks

We propose two different learning models, i.e., Linear Threshold Learning Model and Random Walk Learning Model, to learn the diffusion probability between each pair of users. To get the diffusion probability, we solve the mathematical models using the solver Gurobi and propose an approximate approach using deep neural network (TensorFlow).
